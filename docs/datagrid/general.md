DataGrid
===

The DataGrid is a versatile tool registered together with the Highcharts Dashboards package for visualizing and editing tabular data.
It can be a part of a dashboard or used as a standalone component, but requires a Dashboards license.  
By incorporating this component, users can effectively interact with data in a structured and editable table format.


## Installation
- The package can be imported through a script tag from the Highcharts CDN like this:

    ```html
    <script src="https://code.highcharts.com/dashboards/datagrid.js"></script>
    ```

- Or it can be installed through NPM like this:

    ```bash
    npm install @highcharts/dashboards
    ```
    Then import the module like this:

    ```typescript
    import * as DataGrid from '@highcharts/dashboards/datagrid';
    ```
