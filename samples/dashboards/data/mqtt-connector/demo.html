<div class="description"><p>This demo shows how to connect to an <a href="https://mqtt.org/" target="-blank">MQTT</a>
    broker and subscribe to a topic. The data is then displayed in a Highcharts chart and a Dashboard datagrid.
    The demo also shows how to implement a <i>Custom Connector</i> in Javascript, in his case MQTT. The Custom Connector 
    establishes the connection with the MQTT broker, subscribes to a topic and receives the data. The received
    data are stored in the connector's data table for use in the chart and datagrid. The connector also supports 
    callbacks for connection status, packet reception and error handling. The connector is a sub-class of the <i>DataConnector</i>
    and uses the JSON Converter to convert the received data to a format that can be used by the chart and datagrid.</p>
    <p>The data provider is <b>Sognekraft AS</b>, a Norwegian hydro-electricity producer. The dataset features two
    power plants: <i>Kr√•keelvi</i> and <i>Brekkeelvi</i>. The dataset contains a number of real-time power production
    parameters but in this particular demo the generated power is displayed (megawatts). The measurement data are updated 
    every 2 minutes.</p>
