    <p>This demo shows how to connect to an <a href="https://mqtt.org/" target="-blank">MQTT</a>
        broker and subscribe to a topic. The data is then displayed in a <i>Highcharts chart</i> and a <i>Dashboards datagrid</i>.
        The demo also shows how to implement a <i>Custom Connector</i> in Javascript, in his case MQTT. The Custom
        Connector establishes the connection with the MQTT broker, subscribes to a topic and receives the data. The received
        data are stored in the connector's data table for use in the chart and datagrid. The connector also supports
        callbacks for connection status, packet reception and error handling. The connector is a sub-class of the
        <i>DataConnector</i> and uses the JSON Converter to convert the received data to a format that can be used by the chart and datagrid.

    <p>TBD: Data format and how to provide data.</p>
